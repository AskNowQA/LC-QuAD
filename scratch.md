Things to accomplish next:

Major:

- Extend subgraph to return an iterator for mappings
- Write generate query code
- ~~\[DONE\] Update, and fix templates~~
- ~~\[DONE\] Add uri type to subgraph~~
- ~~\[DONE\] Test uri type in subgraph~~

Minor:

- Rework dbpedia interface
- Rework nlutils, to internally call functions properly.
    No code duplication
- \[DONE\] Write a warning system which neatly breaks lines

Feeling Lucky:

- Extend generator_vanilla to generate all sorts of SPARQLs
    (using everything from templates)
- Write code to gen SPARQL, which is agnostic to actual template str.
- Clean up the repo, and file structure.
